## Design Choices

The goals was to keep the design for this simple and clean.

### Typography

I kept the fonts simple and Used lato and Roboto. I used Roboto fonts for the project logo and then used lato 
for the rest of the fonts. it waas to keep with theme of keeping everthing nice and simple. 

### Colours 

I didn't want to many colour for my projects I wanted to keep to a total of three colours. Those colours were
black, white and mint green. I wanted to green for my logo because it's nice and vibrant and makes the logo stand out
whilst remaining simple. The black and white, black being the colour of the fonts and white colour of the webiste
would balance would bring everthing together. 

### Imagery

I looked at sites such as Nike adn JD to give me an idea on the type of images to use. From the looking at those site
i decided to on what images i would use and how to lay them out. Also using ideas from boutique ado i used a pic image 
of a pair of trainer. All my images are images of trainers just diffrent brands. I included a carousel of trainers and 
called it  top of the steps, the idea behind this is that those are the trainers that are trending on the site.
